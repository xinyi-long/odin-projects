  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>This Hanukkah brisket will literally fall apart in your mouth. The recipe was given to me by my Jewish 
    friend. We made it for a work potluck, and it was a hit.
  </p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (4 pound) beef brisket</li>
    <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
    <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans beef broth</li>
    <li>2 (15 ounce) cans French onion soup</li>
    <li>2 (12 fluid ounce) cans or bottles beer</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Place a large roasting pan over medium-high heat. Sear brisket, fat-side down first, in 
      the hot pan until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Remove brisket from the pan and set aside.</li>
    <li>Place onion slices into the bottom of the same roasting pan; pour 1 can beef broth, 1 can French 
      onion soup, and 1 can beer over onions. Lay brisket on top; pour remaining beef broth, French onion
       soup, and beer over brisket. Cover the roasting pan with a lid.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 3 hours. Let brisket stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove brisket from the roasting pan and wrap tightly in aluminum foil. Pour pan juices and onion 
      into a food storage container and cover tightly with a lid. Refrigerate brisket and pan juices, 8 hours 
      to overnight.</li>
    <li>The next day, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour pan juices and onion into a 
      9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
    <li>Unwrap brisket, cut away any visible fat, and slice thinly across the grain of the meat. Place brisket
       slices into pan juices.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pan juices are thickened and meat is hot, about 45 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
